This is the mailinabox test suite. IT uses the excellent pytest module to check the functionality
of the different services.

Usage
=====

start-up a vagrant box

    vagrant up

install test requirements

    pip install pytest caldav pycarddav

run the tests

    pytest

to just run a subset of the tests (e.g. the ssh related ones):

    pytest test_ssh.py
    
    
Contributing
============

pytest auto-discovers all tests in this directory. The test functions need to be named "test_..."
and there needs to be at least one assert statement.
